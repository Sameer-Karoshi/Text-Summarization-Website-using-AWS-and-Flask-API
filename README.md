# **Text Summarization Website using AWS and Flask API**

>Text Summarization is an effective technique to extract important phrases and sentences from a long and monotonous document. It has applications in education, research, news articles, etc. But even if a fully functional text summarizer is developed, it cannot be of much use if it works only on our local machine. The code must be deployed on the internet so the people who need it can be benefitted. Keeping this is mind, we have deployed a text summarizer on AWS and created a website wherein the users will enter a short text and that text will be go to the summarizer through flask API and again path will be retraced. At last the summary will be displayed in few sentences.

## Technology and Language Used:

- Python - Langauge Used.
- NLP - Natural Language Processing for Text Summarization.
- NLTK - Natural Language Tool Kit Library Used for Text Summarization.
- Flask - For creating an API.
- AWS - For creating EC2 Instance and Deploying all code to that instance.
- HTML - For Creating Template for Website.

## Steps:
- First install NLTK and Flask on your local machine.
- Create a python code for text summarization and flask api.
- Create an website using html.
- Sign in to the aws console and create a new EC2 instance.
- Install putty and filezilla on your local machine.
- Using puttyGen convert a key from .ppm to .ppk.
- Connect to the server through Putty and transer all files to the server using filezilla.
- Install all required library and packages to the server through putty using command promt.
- Finaly, run the python script, flask app and website to the server.
